### Example Usage

```cpp
#include "serial_port_api.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {

    serial_port_api serial_port("COM5");

    // Opening the serial port
    if (!serial_port.open("COM5")) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open the serial port!\n";
        return 1;
    }
  
    while (true)
    {
        // Data transmission
        serial_port.transmit("Hello, serial port!");

        serial_port.polling();
